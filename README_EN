<p>
	The settings for the Jitsi app can be changed under Jitsi's app settings here in the App Center.
</p>
<h2>
	Authentication
</h2>
<p>
	Jitsi allows different use cases regarding authentication depending on the setting combinations.
</p>
<h3>
	Every user
</h3>
<p>
	To allow any user access to Jitsi, you need to disable <i>Authentication</i> in the app's settings.
</p>
<h3>
	Only activated users
</h3>
<p>
	To only allow users with accounts in the UCS LDAP directory that are activated for Jitsi, you need to disable <i>Guest access</i>. Every user then needs to authenticate to gain access to a room.
</p>
<h3>
	Only authenticated users can start a conference
</h3>
<p>
	This is the standard configuration. It allows guest users without account to join a conference. This conference needs to be started by any authenticated user with an account in the UCS LDAP directory activated for Jitsi.
</p>
<h3>
	Deactivate users
</h3>
<p>
	For authentication Jitsi maintains some cache. When a user in the UCS LDAP Directory is disabled to use Jitsi, access is not blocked immediately. This cache time needs to run out first.
</p>
<h2>
	Firewall
</h2>
<p>
	When Jitsi meet is operated behind a firewall, please make sure to open the UDP port 10,000. On this local UCS system the port was automatically opened during installation.
